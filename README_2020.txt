The python file "main.py" is used to analyze the Stack Overflow 2020 survey.
Due to deviations in each survey published by Stack Overflow.
I am not including the survey files, I am not including them in this repo.
If you wish to download it, you may do so here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
I've created a git ignore that removes survey files from the repo.
I created a report that outlines a few of my findings. You can view it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CO-F-L5700KG7UPCp4fvlSYT19rXHW0C/view?usp=sharing
